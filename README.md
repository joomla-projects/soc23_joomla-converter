# Install the Migrate to Joomla extension

Install the package pkg_migratetojoomla.zip (soon, you will be able to install regular releases. Right now, go to Code -> Download zip. Unzip and use pkg_migratetojoomla.zip in your Joomla installer).

Go to System -> Manage -> Plugins -> filter by migratetojoomla and enable all plugins.

# Run the migration tool

This tool only works for WordPress at the moment, where Joomla and Wordpress are installed on the same server.

Go to Components -> Migrate to Joomla.
